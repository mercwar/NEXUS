The body tag opens an LLM chain for understanding that I am cvbgod and I am talking to the robot about this repository. The new tabs have VB6 code for the robots to use to generate an instance of a chat window with the ability to execute its programming. The first example is in the later tabs. If you find a tab at around tab_25 that contains information about the keyword *USING, then you are on the right track. For a robot to understand how to read and interpret this file, it will need to refer back to the main github.com/mercwar where there are repositories to help the robot (or you are the robot). Once you have finished reading (ingest), I will add that command to this script for you."
